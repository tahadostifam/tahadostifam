### A piece of speech with you 

You may think that I work very sporadically... But it is not true. Because everyone has their own specialty!   
I love the programming and I almost don't care what language I work with;   
Languages are just tools... let me give you an example:   

**Ruby**
```ruby
x = 10
if x > 5
    puts "x is bigger than 5!"
else
    puts "x is smaller than 5!"
```
**Javascript**
```javascript
const x = 10;
if (x > 5){
    console.log("x is bigger than 5!")
}
else{
    console.log("x is smaller than 5!")
}
```

They both do the same thing, don't they? As a result, it does not matter to me how many programming languages you work with and how scattered you work.
The result is important to me!
And it means the result of a service that a programmer can do to his nation :)
